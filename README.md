# Custodia OAuth2 IdP

[![CI](https://github.com/chrisyalamov/custodia/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/chrisyalamov/custodia/actions/workflows/main.yml)

Custodia is a simple TypeScript library intended to help developers implement an OAuth2 Identity Provider, compliant with [RFC 6749](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749). This library supports the Authorization Code Grant flow.

By using handler functions, Custodia can implement with most databasesâ€” you, as the developer, define how Custodia interacts with your chosen database.

## This project is in early development

This codebase is not yet suitable for use in other projects. As I make progress with this project, I hope to add other grant type flows and improved documentation.
