# Custodia OAuth2 IdP

Custodia is a simple TypeScript library which can be used to create an OAuth2 Identity Provider (IdP) that handles Authorization Code grant flows.

By using handler functions, Custodia can implement with most databasesâ€” you, as the developer, define how Custodia interacts with your chosen database.

## This project is in early development

As I make progress with this project, I hope to add other grant type flows.
